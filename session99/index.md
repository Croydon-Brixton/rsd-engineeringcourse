Installation Instructions
=========================

Introduction
------------

This document contains instructions for installation of the packages we'll be using during the
course. You will be following the training on your own machines, so please complete these instructions.

**If you encounter any problem during insallation** and you manage to solve them (feel free to ask us for help), please remember to add an issue to the [course repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rsd-engineeringcourse), explaining the problem and solution. In this way we can improve the instructions for future users.

What we're installing
---------------------

For the software carpentry session on programming, we'll be using the language *Python* and in
particular versions >= 3.5. We will use the *Enthought Canopy* python distribution which contains a good
collection of the most common *Python* modules as well as *IPython* (an improved *Python*
interpreter) and the IPython notebook (a useful web-based user interface that allows you to create
documents that combine text and *Python* code, executable with the same browser window).  We'll need
*pip*, the package installer for *Python*, as well.

For the session on version control, we'll be using *Git* and the *Github* website.
